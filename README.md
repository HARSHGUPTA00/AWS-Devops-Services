## What is a cloud ?
The cloud is a global network of remote servers that store and process data for other devices and computers.

## What is a difference between public cloud and private cloud ?
- Public cloud
A third-party provider manages the infrastructure, which is shared among multiple customers. Customers can access the cloud's resources on-demand as a fully managed service.
- Private cloud
A single organization controls and maintains the infrastructure, which is not shared with other organizations. The organization can host the private cloud on-premises or use a private cloud provider.

## What is a cloud computing ?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, or "the cloud". These services include storage, servers, software, networking, databases, analytics, and intelligence.

## What is a Amazon web servies ?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. It provides a wide range of on-demand services like computing power, storage, and databases, allowing businesses to scale and manage their IT resources efficiently. AWS offers services such as EC2 for virtual servers, S3 for scalable storage, RDS for managed databases, and Lambda for serverless computing. By using AWS, companies can reduce infrastructure costs, improve flexibility, and deploy applications globally with ease.

## Why we used cloud computing particularly AWS ?
 It allows for scalable, flexible IT infrastructure with pay-as-you-go pricing, eliminating the need to manage physical servers, enabling rapid deployment of applications, global reach, and access to a wide range of services like compute, storage, databases, and analytics, all while significantly reducing costs and increasing agility compared to traditional on-premise infrastructure.

## What is a Advantages of AWS ?
- Cost Efficient – AWS does not necessitate any upfront investment, long-term commitment, or minimum expense for the setup of Cloud Infrastructure.
- Flexibility – AWS offers Effortless hosting of Applications and it provides instant availability of new features and technology.
- Scalability – AWS offer Features like AutoScaling and Elastic Load Balancing and their scale Increase and Decrease according to demand or traffic on the application.
- Security – AWS provides end-to-end encryption technology and privacy to its customers
